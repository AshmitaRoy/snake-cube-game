# snake-cube-game
 Snake, but with a twist - instead of on a flat singular plane, it is on a cube, with the snake able to go over all planes on the cube. The standard rules of snake apply (eat a piece of ‘food’ and the snake gets larger and you get points, if you collide with your snake, or optionally any obstacles it’s game over)
